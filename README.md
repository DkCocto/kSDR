# kSDR
Simple Fast SDR receiver app with OpenGL


I would like to present to your attention the kSDR application for working with popular SDR devices.

The application uses OpenGL to render the user interface. This allows you to get a pleasant experience of interacting with the controls of the program, as well as a smooth output of the spectrum and waterfall.

Unfortunately, this fact imposes some limitations. In particular, the computer must contain a video card capable of running OpenGL.

The program is in early beta. At the moment, kSDR allows you to work with devices:
1) rsp1
2) rsp1a
3) rtlsdr
4) hackrf (not yet fully supported)

The application is currently configured to receive signals in the range from 1 to 30 MHz. Supported modulations: AM, USB, LSB.

Work on the application is in full swing. The source codes are completely open.

I would like to receive user reviews or any feedback. This will push the progress of the application.

Thank you!
