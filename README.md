I would like to present to your attention the kSDR application for working with popular SDR devices.

The application uses OpenGL to render the user interface. This allows you to get a pleasant experience of interacting with the controls of the program, as well as a smooth output of the spectrum and waterfall.

Unfortunately, this fact imposes some limitations. In particular, the computer must contain a video card capable of running OpenGL.

The program is in beta. At the moment, kSDR allows you to work with devices:

1) rsp1/rsp1a (supported api 3)
2) hackrf
3) rtlsdr

The application is currently configured to receive signals in the range from 1 to 30 MHz. Supported modulations: AM, USB, LSB, nFM.

Work on the application is in full swing. The source codes are completely open.

<b>Important</b><br>
------

When you launch the app for the first time, you will most likely need to go to the settings and select your device from the list. It is also necessary to correctly select the sampling rate and the Fourier transform length (FFT length). This will make the spectrum more informative.

I would like to receive user reviews or any feedback. This will push the progress of the application.

Please, if you are interested in this project or you have difficulty in launching the application for any reason, please contact us by e-mail:
